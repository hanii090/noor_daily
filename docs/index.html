    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Noor Daily ("we", "our", "the app") is an Islamic guidance application that provides daily Quran verses, Hadith, and spiritual tools matched to your mood. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data.</p>

    <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>All data is stored locally on your device only:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your name (if voluntarily provided during onboarding)</li>
        <li>App preferences (dark mode, language, notification settings, reciter choice)</li>
        <li>Saved verses and hadiths (favorites/bookmarks)</li>
        <li>Mood selection history</li>
        <li>30-Day Spiritual Journey progress and streaks</li>
        <li>Exam Mode session history</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>We do NOT collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.</strong> All user data remains exclusively on your device via local storage (AsyncStorage). We have no user accounts, no analytics tracking, and no advertising.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app connects to the following external services solely to fetch Islamic content:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reminder.dev API</strong> — to retrieve Quran verses, Hadith collections, and the 99 Names of Allah. No personal data is sent in these requests.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Cloud Functions</strong> — to generate AI-powered spiritual insights (Tafsir) for verses and hadiths. Only the verse or hadith text is sent for processing; no personal identifiers, device information, or user data is transmitted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Notifications</h2>
    <p>The app may send local push notifications for daily guidance reminders and journey streak alerts. These notifications are scheduled entirely on your device. You can disable notifications at any time in the app's Settings screen or through your device's system settings.</p>

    <h2>5. Photos &amp; Media</h2>
    <p>The app requests photo library access solely to allow you to save shareable verse and hadith cards to your device's gallery. No photos are uploaded, transmitted, or accessed beyond this purpose.</p>

    <h2>6. Audio</h2>
    <p>The app streams Quran audio recitations from public CDN sources. No personal data is sent during audio playback.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Noor Daily is suitable for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The app contains no inappropriate content, advertising, or in-app purchases.</p>

    <h2>8. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can delete all app data at any time by navigating to <strong>Settings → Reset App</strong>. This permanently removes all locally stored preferences, history, saved items, and journey progress. Alternatively, uninstalling the app from your device will also remove all associated data.</p>

    <h2>9. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, it is protected by your device's built-in security measures (screen lock, encryption). We do not have access to any of your data.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>11. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact us at:</p>
