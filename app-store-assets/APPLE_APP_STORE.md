# Apple App Store Listing — Noor Daily

> Complete App Store Connect metadata, ready to paste.

---

## App Name (30 chars max)

```
Noor Daily - Quran & Hadith
```

**Character count:** 28/30

**Why this option:** "Quran" and "Hadith" are the two highest-volume Islamic app keywords on the App Store. Including both in the name gives maximum search visibility. "Noor Daily" establishes the brand while "Quran & Hadith" tells users exactly what they get.

---

## Subtitle (30 chars max)

```
Your Daily Islamic Companion
```

**Character count:** 29/30

**Why this option:** Conveys the value proposition (daily companion = habit/routine) while including "Islamic" as a keyword not already in the title. Emotionally warm — positions the app as a friend, not a tool.

## Keywords (100 chars max — comma-separated, no spaces after commas)

```
quran,hadith,islam,muslim,prayer,dua,tafsir,spiritual,ramadan,student,exam,arabic,verses,daily,dhikr
```

**Character count:** 100/100

**Keyword strategy:**
- **NOT in title/subtitle** (Apple indexes those separately): quran is in title but Apple deduplicates, so all keywords here add incremental value
- **High volume:** quran, hadith, islam, muslim, prayer, dua, ramadan
- **Differentiators:** student, exam (low competition, high intent)
- **Long-tail triggers:** tafsir, spiritual, dhikr, verses, arabic, daily
- **Excluded** (already in title/subtitle): "noor", "companion", "islamic" — Apple indexes title+subtitle words automatically

## App Store Connect Tips

1. **Localize** the listing for Arabic, Urdu, and Turkish markets — even basic translations of the description dramatically increase conversion in those regions
2. **A/B test** the first 3 lines of the description (App Store Connect supports this natively)
3. **Update promotional text** during Ramadan, exam seasons (May/December), and Islamic holidays — no review required
4. **Seasonal keywords** — swap "ramadan" for "hajj" or "eid" as seasons change (keywords require a new version submission)
