## Google Play Differences from Apple

| Element | Apple App Store | Google Play |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Description formatting | Plain text only (no emoji in description) | Emoji + Unicode formatting encouraged |
| Keywords field | Dedicated 100-char field | No keyword field — all SEO is in title + short + full description |
| Short description | No equivalent | 80-char field (critical for search) |
| Promotional text | 170 chars (editable anytime) | No equivalent |
| A/B testing | Native in App Store Connect | Native in Google Play Console (store listing experiments) |

**Key Google Play SEO notes:**
1. Google indexes **every word** in the full description — repeat important keywords naturally 2-3 times
2. The short description is the **most weighted field** after the title for ranking
3. Use emojis in the full description — they improve readability and conversion on Play Store
4. Google Play allows **custom store listing** per country — create Arabic/Urdu/Turkish variants
