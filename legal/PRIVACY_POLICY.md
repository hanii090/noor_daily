Last updated: February 6, 2026

Noor Daily ("we", "us", or "our") operates the Noor Daily mobile application (the "App").

### 1. Information Collection and Use

We are committed to protecting your privacy. Noor Daily is designed to collect as little personal information as possible.

- **Personal Data:** We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, or phone number.

The App uses local notifications to provide daily verses. You can manage these notifications through the App settings or your device's system settings.

### 3. Media Library Access

When you save or share a verse card, the App requests access to your device's media library to save the image. This access is only used for the intended purpose of saving the card.

### 4. Data Security

The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### 5. Third-Party Services

The App may use third-party services (such as Quran APIs) to fetch content. These services have their own privacy policies.

Our App does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.
