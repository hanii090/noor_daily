# Privacy Policy for Noor Daily

Last updated: February 8, 2026

Noor Daily ("we", "us", or "our") operates the Noor Daily mobile application (the "App").

### 1. Information Collection and Use

We are committed to protecting your privacy. Noor Daily is designed to collect as little personal information as possible.

- **Personal Data:** We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, phone number, or account credentials. No account or sign-up is required to use the App.
- **Device Identifiers:** We do not collect or store device IDs, advertising identifiers, or any unique hardware identifiers.
- **User-Provided Name:** If you choose to enter your name during onboarding or in Settings, it is stored exclusively on your device and is never transmitted to any server.
- **Favorites, History & Journal Entries:** Your saved verses, hadiths, reading history, mood selections, streak data, and journey journal entries are stored locally on your device using AsyncStorage. We do not have access to this data, and it never leaves your device.

### 2. Third-Party Services

The App communicates with the following third-party services to provide content and features:

- **Together AI (api.together.xyz):** When you use AI-powered features (Tafsir explanations, personalized guidance, AI Mentor), the text of the relevant verse or hadith — along with your typed situation description, if applicable — is sent to Together AI's API for processing. No personal identifiers are attached to these requests. Together AI's privacy policy applies to their processing of this data: https://www.together.ai/privacy
- **Reminder.dev API (reminder.dev):** The App fetches Quranic verses, hadith collections, and the 99 Names of Allah from the Reminder.dev API. These are read-only content requests containing no user data.
- **Al-Quran Cloud CDN (cdn.alquran.cloud):** Audio recitation files are streamed from the Al-Quran Cloud content delivery network. These are standard media requests containing no user data.

No personal information, device identifiers, or user content is shared with any third party for advertising, tracking, or profiling purposes.

### 3. Analytics

The App contains analytics event stubs for internal development purposes. As of this version, **no analytics data is collected or transmitted** to any external analytics service. If analytics are enabled in a future update, this policy will be updated accordingly, and only anonymous, aggregated usage data (e.g., feature usage counts, crash diagnostics) will be collected.

### 4. Notifications

The App uses local (on-device) notifications to provide daily Quranic verses, hadiths, and reminders. Notification content is generated and scheduled entirely on your device. You can enable, disable, or configure notifications through the App's Settings screen or your device's system settings at any time.

### 5. Media Library Access

When you choose to save a verse card or wallpaper image, the App requests one-time access to your device's photo library to save the image. This access is used solely for the purpose you initiated and can be revoked in your device's system settings at any time.

### 6. Data Storage and Caching

All user preferences, cached API responses, and app data are stored locally on your device. Cached content (verses, hadiths, names) is stored with time-based expiration and can be cleared at any time via the "Reset App" option in Settings.

### 7. Data Security

All network requests to third-party APIs are made over HTTPS (TLS-encrypted connections). Local data is stored using the platform's standard secure storage mechanisms. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure.

### 8. Children's Privacy

The App is rated 4+ and contains no objectionable content. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone, including children under 13. The App does not require any personal information to function.

### 9. Data Deletion

You can delete all locally stored data at any time by using the "Reset App" option in Settings, or by uninstalling the App. Since we do not collect or store any data on our servers, there is no server-side data to delete.

### 10. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date above.
